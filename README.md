## Overview

This is my professional resume as a static webpage.  If I ever find myself unemployed, you can bet this project will become a lot more rich and dynamic ;)

## Credits

- [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) for all the - you guessed it - boilerplate.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) provided the non-standard fonts.  They kinda kill my page performance, but they're so pretty!
- [Google Doc Resume Templates](https://docs.google.com/templates) gave me the initial style inspiration.  I am not a visual designer.  I emulated the template called 'Modern Writer'.
